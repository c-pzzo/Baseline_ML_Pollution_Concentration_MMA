# About files in this folder
Each CSV file in this folder contains measurements for different pollutant or meteorological values as originally taken from different monitoring stations in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA).

The observation period is set to one hour, as defined by the ground-based monitoring station.

The date-time column for each file has been modified to adapt to a standard format so it can be directly read from the MySQL RDBMS or Python environment.
