# Instructions
! Note: The commands defined in the following files contain MySQL commands, so a functional MySQL environment is needed. PhpMyAdmin was used and is recommended.

Commands within the following files were created using Python `s0_Table_Generation.ipynb`.

Most files in this folder contain simple SQL table structures and can be executed on the MySQL command prompt or a MySQL GUI. 
`1- CREATE Catalogues and INSERT Values (Execute on SQL Terminal or GUI)`
`2- CREATE Tables (Execute on SQL Terminal or GUI)`
`3- CREATE Views (Execute on SQL Terminal or GUI)`

An approach for inserting data for the empty tables, requires the MySQL command propmt and setting the local-infile global system variable to true. This command is defined in the following file:
`4- Set Global (SQL Terminal)`

Finally, execute on Terminal the commands to insert each CSV file with Restructured Data to the new tables:
`5- Terminal commands (Terminal).`
